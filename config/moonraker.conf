[file_manager]
queue_gcode_uploads: False
#   When set to True the file manager will add uploads to the job_queue when
#   the `start_print` flag has been set.  The default if False.
enable_object_processing: False
#   When set to True gcode files will be run through a "preprocessor"
#   during metadata extraction if object tags are detected.  This preprocessor
#   replaces object tags with G-Code commands compatible with Klipper's
#   "cancel object" functionality.  Note that this process is file I/O intensive,
#   it is not recommended for usage on low resource SBCs such as a Pi Zero.
#   The default is False.
file_system_observer: inotify
#   The observer used to monitor file system changes.  May be inotify or none.
#   When set to none file system observation is disabled.  The default is
#   inotify.
enable_observer_warnings: True
#   When set to True Moonraker will generate warnings when an observer
#   encounters an error. This may be useful to determine if the observer
#   malfunctioning. The default is True.
#enable_inotify_warnings: True
#   *** DEPRECATED - SEE "enable_observer_warnings" ***
#   When set to True Moonraker will generate warnings when inotify attempts
#   to add a duplicate watch or when inotify encounters an error.  On some
#   file systems inotify may not work as expected, this gives users the
#   option to suppress warnings when necessary.  The default is True.


[job_queue]

load_on_startup: False
#   When set to true the job queue will attempt to load the next
#   pending job when Klipper reports as "Ready".  If the queue has
#   been paused it will automatically resume.  Note that neither
#   the job_transition_delay nor the job_transition_gcode are
#   applied in this case.  The default is False.
automatic_transition: False
#   When set to True the queue will automatically transition to
#   the next job in the queue after the current job is complete.
#   This is useful for belt printers and other machines with the
#   ability to automate clearing of the build area.  When False
#   the queue will be paused after each job is loaded, requiring
#   that users manually resume to load the next print.  The default
#   is False.
#job_transition_delay:
#   The amount of time to delay after completion of a job before
#   loading the next job on the queue.  The default is no delay.
#job_transition_gcode:
#   A gcode to execute after the completion of a job before the next
#   job is loaded.  If a "job_transition_delay" has been configured
#   this gcode will run after the delay.  The default is no gcode.

[octoprint_compat]

enable_ufp: True
#   When set to True the octoprint_compat module will report that the UFP
#   plugin is available.  If the installed version of Cura supports UFP
#   files will be uploaded in UFP format.  When set to False Cura will
#   upload files in .gcode format.  This setting has no impact on other
#   slicers.  The default is True.

flip_h: False
#   Set the webcam horizontal flip.  The default is False.
flip_v: False
#   Set the webcam vertical flip.  The default is False.
rotate_90: False
#   Set the webcam rotation by 90 degrees.  The default is False.
stream_url: /webcam/?action=stream
#   The URL to use for streaming the webcam.  It can be set to an absolute
#   URL if needed. In order to get the webcam to work in Cura through
#   an OctoPrint connection, you can set this value to
#   http://<octoprint ip>/webcam/?action=stream.  The default value is
#   /webcam/?action=stream.
webcam_enabled: True
#   Enables the webcam.  The default is True.

[machine]
provider: systemd_dbus
#   The provider implementation used to collect system service information
#   and run service actions (ie: start, restart, stop).  This can be "none",
#   "supervisord_cli", "systemd_dbus", or "systemd_cli".  If the provider is
#   set to "none" service action APIs will be disabled.
#   The default is systemd_dbus.
shutdown_action: poweroff
#   Determines the action Moonraker will take when a shutdown is requested.
#   This option may be set to "halt" or "poweroff. Not all linux distributions
#   support poweroff, in such scenarios it is necessary to specify 'halt'.
#   The default is "poweroff".
#sudo_password:
#   The password for the linux user.  When set Moonraker can run linux commands
#   that require elevated permissions.  This option accepts Jinja2 Templates,
#   see the [secrets] section for details.  It is strongly recommended to only
#   set this option when required and to use the aforementioned secrets module
#   when doing so.  The default is no sudo password is set.
validate_service: False
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's systemd service unit.  If Moonraker
#   detects that a change is necessary it will attempt to do so.  Custom
#   installations and installations that do systemd should set this to False.
#   The default is True.
validate_config: True
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's configuration.  If Moonraker detects
#   deprecated options it will attempt to correct them.  The default is True.
force_validation: False
#   By default Moonraker will not attempt to revalidate if a previous attempt
#   at validation successfully completed. Setting this value to True will force
#   Moonraker to perform validation.  The default is False.
#supervisord_config_path:
#   Path to the supervisord config file. This is required when for multiple
#   supervisord are instances running on single machine and the default
#  '/var/run/supervisord.sock' is occupied by other services.
#   The default is no path.
